# How to Use
1. Connect the wired controller.

2. Pull the power switch on the side of the unit to turn it on.

3. Press the power button on the wired controller to turn on the controller power.
   * You can turn on the main power without the wired controller, but control will not be possible.

4. Select the desired mode using the mode button on the wired controller.
 
5. When controlling with the wired controller, set the mode button to “Manual” and move the wiper left and right to control the unit.
   * Turning it to the left moves the unit backward; turning it to the right moves the unit forward.
   * Whenever possible, operate while staying close to the unit (beware of sudden acceleration; although low-speed mode is applied in wired control, malfunction may occur if the cable becomes disconnected).

6. When controlling with the wireless controller, set the mode button to “RF” and remove the wired controller from the unit.

7. On the wireless controller, the position of “Switch C” selects between “Safe”, “Low-speed mode”, and “High-speed mode.”

8. Control the unit by moving the right throttle up and down.
   * Pushing it up moves the unit forward; pulling it down moves the unit backward.
   * If communication is lost, the unit will stop after approximately 2 seconds.
   * Considering the speed of the unit, reduce speed and control carefully when the unit is sufficiently close to the destination.
